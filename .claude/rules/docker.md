# Container image rules (Docker Hardened Images (dhi.io)

- Multi-stage: build in a full-toolchain image, run in the smallest runtime image of the same family. Base image family: `dhi`; do not mix families (glibc vs musl packages are not interchangeable). A `stack: custom` Dockerfile is hand-written and must still honour `ARG VERSION`/`ARG COMMIT`, the health endpoint, a non-root runtime and environment-only configuration (see the plugin's `stack-custom.md`).
- Runtime images run as non-root, contain no shell or package manager, and expose only the app port declared in `.slipway/config.yaml`.
- Accept `ARG VERSION` and stamp it as the OCI label `org.opencontainers.image.version` and into the app (`/health` returns it) so `/slipway:verify` can compare running version to tag.
- No secrets, tokens or `.env` files copied into any layer; configuration arrives as environment variables at runtime.
- Each app has a `.dockerignore` excluding VCS, build output, tests fixtures and local env files. The build context is the app path; it becomes the repository root only when the app builds inputs outside its path (`paths` in `.slipway/config.yaml`), and then `Dockerfile.dockerignore` next to the Dockerfile carries the ignore rules.
- Templates and pinned tags: the `delivery-knowledge` skill, `references/base-image-dhi.md`.
