## Non-negotiables (taskflow)
- Infrastructure changes go through Terraform under the slipway guard hooks. `terraform apply` for `infra/foundation` needs a human approval token; `infra/apps/<app>` is applied only by that app's CD workflow. Never `-auto-approve`, never `destroy` from a session.
- Never commit secrets, `*.tfvars` (other than `*.example`), state, plan or `.env` files. Secrets are referenced (`var.*`, Key Vault references, `${{ secrets.NAME }}`), never written. The seed file `.slipway/.env` is only ever sourced into a command (`set -a; . .slipway/.env; set +a`), never read, printed or pasted; secrets reach GitHub from the clipboard or that file (`gh secret set NAME --body …`), and their values never appear in the conversation.
- Cloud and GitHub administration (`setup-azure.sh --apply`, environments, rulesets, deployment approvals, secrets) runs in this session only behind the permission prompt the guard hook forces; unattended sessions are denied and hand the command to a human.
- Image tags are immutable semver produced by the configured versioning tool (Nerdbank.GitVersioning). Never push or deploy `latest` or a branch name.
- `.slipway/config.yaml` is the single source of truth for delivery options and apps. Change it with `/slipway:bootstrap`; do not hand-edit generated files to switch options.
- Verify before asserting: a claim about a build, deployment or ticket needs a command output or URL as evidence (`/slipway:verify`).
- Do not weaken or bypass hooks, rules or tests to get a green result; report the blocker instead.
- Work tracking for this repository goes through `/slipway:ticket` only (tracker, project, epic and story from `.slipway/config.yaml`): one subtask per unit of work under the current story, kept current by the skill doing the work. Tracking never blocks delivery: `tracker: none` disables it and an unreachable tracker queues the updates for `/slipway:ticket sync`. Personal or org-level Jira skills and commands do not apply here.
